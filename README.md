# Hi 👋! I am Shanker KC, M.Eng. (Geodesy).

I am truly fascinated by changing shape of the Earth.

Currently, I am working as a Geodetic Engineer at Survey Department, building terresrial reference frame & vertical reference frame. Interested in solving challanges & problems of climate change and natural hazards by especially mastering the field of Geodesy and Geophysics.

## Research Interests
- Time-Variable Gravity Field of the Earth, Ice Mass Change, Sea-Level Change
- Solid Earth Deformation Process: Vertical Land Motion (VLM), Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), Tidal and Non-Tidal Loading
- Geodesy for Climate Change and Natural Hazards
- AI in/for Geodesy

## Geodetic Methods & Technologies
- Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
- Satellite Gravimetry: GRACE/GRACE-FO,
- InSAR,
